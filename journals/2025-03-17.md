Today, I explored the capabilities of GitHub Copilot while creating an interactive Python program that interprets data from a CSV file. This experience highlighted the power of AI-assisted coding and how it can streamline the development process.

## Project Overview

The program allows users to perform various data analysis tasks interactively. As users navigate through the program, they are prompted with questions to guide their analysis, such as whether they want to generate a histogram or calculate statistical measures like mean and median.

### Key Features

1. **Data Loading**: The program reads data from a specified CSV file and displays the first few rows for user confirmation.
2. **Interactive Prompts**: Users are asked questions to determine what kind of analysis they want to perform.
3. **Statistical Calculations**: Options to calculate mean, median, and mode of selected columns.
4. **Data Visualization**: Users can choose to generate histograms for visual representation of the data.

### Implementation

Using GitHub Copilot, I was able to quickly generate the necessary code snippets for loading the CSV file, performing calculations, and creating visualizations. The AI suggestions helped me focus on the logic and flow of the program rather than getting bogged down in syntax.

### Example Output

One of the outputs from the program is a histogram that visually represents the distribution of data in one of the columns. Here's an example of the histogram generated:

![Histogram of column3](images/histogram.png)

Overall, today's experience with GitHub Copilot and Python programming was incredibly rewarding. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and exploring more data analysis capabilities.
