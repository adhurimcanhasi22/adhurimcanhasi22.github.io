## MongoDB Shell and Compass Experience

Today marked my first hands-on experience with MongoDB, where I successfully connected to the database using both MongoDB Shell and MongoDB Compass. Here's what I accomplished:

### MongoDB Connection and Basic Operations

1. **Connecting to MongoDB**

   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

2. **Creating a Collection and Inserting Data**

   ```javascript
   // Creating and using a database
   use studentsDB

   // Inserting student data
   db.students.insertOne({
     name: "Adhurim",
     age: 20,
     city: "Mitrovica"
   })
   ```

The MongoDB Compass GUI provided a visual interface that made it easier to understand the database structure and document relationships. It was fascinating to see how NoSQL databases handle data differently from traditional SQL databases.

## Advanced Programming

In today's Advanced Programming course, we were introduced to Qwen.AI, a powerful AI tool for programming assistance. We used it to create a simple JavaScript program:

```javascript
// Simple greeting program using JavaScript
function greetUser() {
  const name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
  if (name) {
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  } else {
    alert("Hello, stranger!");
  }
}

// Call the function when page loads
greetUser();
```

### Key Learnings from Qwen.AI:

- Quick prototype generation
- Code explanation capabilities
- Best practices suggestions
- Error handling recommendations

## Modeling and Simulation: Circuit Analysis

In today's Modeling and Simulation lab, I conducted circuit analysis using DC sweep mode to observe voltage-current relationships. The simulation provided valuable insights into circuit behavior:

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto;">
    <img src="/images/Detyra_e_pare_graph.jpg" alt="Circuit Analysis Graph" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</div>

### Simulation Parameters:

- Start Value: -150.0V
- End Value: 100.0V
- Temperature: 70Â°C
- Analysis Type: DC Sweep

### Key Observations:

1. Linear relationship between voltage and current
2. Expected behavior in the operating region
3. Clear visualization of circuit characteristics
4. Successful validation of theoretical calculations

## Reflections and Next Steps
