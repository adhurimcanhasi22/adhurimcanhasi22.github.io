## 🎉 A Small Step Toward a Big Vision

Today marks the official start of our ambitious project, the **Kosovo Travel Guide**! After weeks of planning, researching, and refining our vision, my team and I finally **set up the foundation of our web application** using **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**.

The goal? To create a seamless, interactive, and modern platform that highlights **Kosovo’s top attractions, historical sites, hotels, and restaurants**—making travel planning effortless for visitors. While we have a long journey ahead, today’s milestone is an important one: **our first commit** into what we hope will be an impactful and widely used platform.

## 🛠️ The Setup Process

We chose **Next.js** for its **server-side rendering (SSR)** capabilities, ensuring better **performance and SEO**. Alongside it, we integrated **Tailwind CSS** to provide a **scalable and flexible design system** for rapid UI development.

### ✅ Steps We Took:

1. **Created the Next.js app** using:

```sh
  npx create-next-app@latest
```

2. **Installed Tailwind CSS** and configured it:

```sh
  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. **Structured the project** for better scalability

4. **Pushed our first commit** to GitHub 🎉

## 👏 Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

This project wouldn’t be possible without my **amazing team**:

- 👨‍💻 **[Scrum Master & Backend Developer]** – _Myself_, leading the project and handling backend logic.
- 🎨 **[UI/UX & Frontend Developer]** – _Arjetë Llapashtica_, designing and implementing the user interface.
- 🗺️ **[Data & Content Specialist]** – _Vjollca Ademi_, gathering key information about attractions, hotels, and restaurants.
- 🔍 **[Testing & Frontend Developer]** – _Blinera Arifi_, ensuring quality, responsiveness, and performance.
