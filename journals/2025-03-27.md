# Learning Journal - March 27, 2025

Today, I learned about GitHub branching and how to effectively organize the repository for the Kosovo Travel Guide web app project for our Lab Course. This experience emphasized the importance of structured version control in collaborative development.

## GitHub Branching Overview

### 1. Creating the Develop Branch

I created a **develop** branch where the website will be tested and reviewed by the team. This branch serves as a staging area for new features and bug fixes before they are merged into the main branch. The workflow will be as follows:

- Team members will push their changes to the develop branch.
- We will conduct reviews and testing to ensure everything functions as expected.
- Once the features are stable and approved, we will merge them into the main branch.

### 2. Establishing the Docs Branch

In addition to the develop branch, I also created a **docs** branch. This branch will contain guides, information, designs, and any other documentation related to building and improving our project. Organizing documentation separately helps keep the main codebase clean and allows team members to easily access important resources.

### 3. Benefits of Branching

- **Collaboration**: Branching allows multiple team members to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
- **Testing**: The develop branch provides a safe environment for testing new features before they go live.
- **Documentation**: Having a dedicated docs branch ensures that all project-related information is organized and easily accessible.

## Key Learnings

1. **Version Control Best Practices**:

   - Understanding the importance of branching in Git for collaborative projects.
   - Learning how to create and manage branches effectively.

2. **Team Collaboration**:

   - Recognizing the value of structured workflows in enhancing team productivity.
   - Gaining insights into how to facilitate better communication and collaboration among team members.

3. **Documentation Importance**:
   - Realizing the significance of maintaining clear and organized documentation for project success.
   - Understanding how proper documentation can aid in onboarding new team members and improving project continuity.

Overall, today's experience with GitHub branching was enlightening. I'm excited to implement these practices in our project and see how they enhance our development process.
