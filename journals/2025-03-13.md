Today, I focused on creating a user flow diagram for my travel planning website using Miro. This diagram visually represents the steps a user will take while navigating through the site, helping to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## User Flow Planning

The user flow diagram outlines the following key interactions:

### User Types

- **Guest**: Can browse the homepage and city pages.
- **Registered User**: Can log in, access a personalized dashboard, bookmark attractions, and save trip itineraries.
- **Admin**: Has access to the admin dashboard for managing content and monitoring analytics.

### Key User Actions

1. **City Page**: Users can view attractions, hotels, and restaurants.
2. **AI Chatbot**: Users can ask questions and receive travel information.
3. **Trip Planning**: Users can start planning their trip, selecting flights, transport, and hotels.
4. **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can write reviews and view ratings for attractions and hotels.
