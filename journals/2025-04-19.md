## ðŸ“… Week 3 Journal â€“ April 19

This week I paused all project-related work to prepare for two university exams.

- ðŸ§  **Big Data Processing** â€“ Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t pass and will need to retake it during the June exam period.
- ðŸ“Š **IT and ERP Accounting** â€“ I managed to pass this one successfully.

No coding or development tasks were done due to full-time exam focus.
