# Learning Journal - March 03, 2025

Today was an exciting day of learning new tools! I dove into both database management with MongoDB and electronic circuit simulation with OrCAD. Here's what I accomplished:

## MongoDB Setup and First Steps

Today I took my first steps into the world of NoSQL databases by installing MongoDB. Here's what I learned:

1. **Installation Process**

   - Downloaded MongoDB Community Server
   - Set up the MongoDB environment
   - Learned about the MongoDB shell interface

2. **Basic MongoDB Commands**

   ```bash
   show dbs              # Lists all databases
   ```

## OrCAD and Circuit Simulation

In parallel, I also started learning OrCAD, specifically using the Capture Lite Edition for circuit simulation:

1. **Software Setup**

   - Installed OrCAD Capture Lite
   - Familiarized myself with the interface
   - Learned basic component placement and wiring

2. **First Circuit Simulation**
   - Created a simple circuit design
   - Learned about PSpice simulation
   - Ran my first successful simulation

Here's the result of my first OrCAD simulation:

## Key Takeaways

1. **MongoDB Insights**

   - Understanding document-based storage
   - Basic database navigation
   - Command-line interface familiarity

2. **OrCAD Learning**
   - Circuit design workflow
   - Component library usage
   - Basic simulation setup

## Next Steps

- [ ] Learn more advanced MongoDB queries
- [ ] Build more complex circuits in OrCAD
- [ ] Learn about different simulation types in PSpice

## Resources Used

- MongoDB Documentation
- OrCAD Capture Lite Tutorial
- PSpice User Guide

Today was productive in terms of learning new tools. Both MongoDB and OrCAD will be valuable additions to my technical skillset, opening up possibilities in both software development and electronic design.
