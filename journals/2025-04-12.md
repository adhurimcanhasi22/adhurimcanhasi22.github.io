# 🗓️ Developer Journal – 12th April 2025

**Kosova Travel Guide (Backend Progress & Advanced Programming Part 2)**

---

## 🌐 Backend Development Focus

This week, I focused entirely on the **backend of the Kosova Travel Guide project**, setting up key features and functionality:

### ✅ What Got Done:

- Set up **Node.js with Express.js** server.
- Connected routes directly to **MongoDB Atlas** for data persistence.
- Integrated **Nodemailer** to send email verifications when users try to sign up or log in.

```js
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

# 🧠 Advanced Programming – Microservice Part 2

**Migrated the User Profile Microservice from in-memory to Supabase PostgreSQL**

## 🔁 Project Migration Documentation: From In-Memory to Supabase

### 1. Migration Summary

| Feature              | Before (Old)        | After (New - Supabase)              |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Storage**          | In-memory `Map()`   | Supabase PostgreSQL                 |
| **Persistence**      | Lost on restart     | Persistent DB                       |
| **Queries**          | Basic object access | SQL-like `supabase.from().insert()` |
| **Production Ready** | ❌                  | ✅                                  |

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
);
module.exports = supabase;
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Switching to Supabase required adjusting async handling and query error checks.

- Nodemailer was smooth to integrate after configuring the .env file properly.

- Testing both through Jest and Postman helped verify stable backend behavior.

- The project backend is now ready with working user registration, login, JWT, and protected routes.
