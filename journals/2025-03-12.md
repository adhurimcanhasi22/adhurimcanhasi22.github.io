Today I focused on creating a comprehensive web architecture diagram for my travel planning website using Miro. This visual representation helps clarify the relationships between different components and services that will power the application.

## Web Architecture Planning

The architecture diagram outlines the following key components:

### Frontend Components
- Main pages (City Page, Trip Planner, Interactive Map)
- User Interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Admin Dashboard for site management
- AI Chatbot integration

### Backend Structure
- Express.js Backend serving as the central hub
- User Authentication system
- Trip Planning Logic
- API Endpoints management
- Database structure for storing:
  - Cities & Attractions
  - Hotels & Restaurants
  - User Profiles
  - Saved Trips & Reviews

### External Services Integration
- OpenAI API for AI queries
- Flight API for travel information
- Currency Exchange API for real-time rates
- Google Maps API for location services
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
